## Overview

bamazon uses mySQL to create a inventory managment system. It has two different parts, one for the manager and one for the Customer.

Displays a list of items in the inventory, takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory. 

The Manager: 
Displays multiple options 
 * View Products for Sale
